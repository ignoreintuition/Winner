                <H3>WELCOME TO WINNER</H3>
                <p> Congratulations on taking your first step towards creating a better life for yourself, yoru family, and those around you </p>
                <p>The idea behind winner is to create a unique way to share experiences, keep friends and family up to date on your latest endeavors, and impress your accomplishments to the people who mean the most to you.  Winner works by providing you an inventory of different accomplishments, or badges, that represent important steps in your life.  By completing the different objectives you can build a profile that represents your success.  It is all in fun and there is no 'checks and balances' so please use the honor system. </p>
                <H4> The Philosophy </H4>
                <p> My philosophy is that by creating a unique, branded method for sharing your accomplishments you are more likely to strive for excellece.  Having a badge that solidfies your accomplishment gives you a feeling of pride.  No different than when you check something off of a to do list or complete a task in a project plan.  It gives some sembalance of order to your life.   </p>
                <p> What makes Winner unique is that it doesn't try to create a brand new social media ecosystem.  Instead it utilizes those well established applications and integrates with them.  Giving you the ability to 'check off' your tasks and work towards completion of your goals.  Those goals can be managed in your profile so you can meet your personalized 100% criteria. </p>
                <H4> How to get involved </H4>
                <P>Currently winner is still in it's prototype phase.</P>
